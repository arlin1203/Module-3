# List Operations in Python- Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

```

numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
total = sum(numbers)
print("Sum of list elements:", total)

```
